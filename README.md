The method of reducing the amount of bits necessary to demonstrate a given captured video sequence is known as video compression. Most video compression is done by a program that uses a specific algorithm or formula to determine the best way to reduce the size of the data. H.264/AVC and H.265/HEVC video compression algorithms can reduce raw content data by up to 1,000 times.

HD 1080p60 has a natural "baseband" bandwidth of 3 Gbps for real-time video. The resulting network video stream can be as low as 1-10 Mbps when compressed. This enables the transmission of real-time video streams or the resulting files over today's standard networks.
